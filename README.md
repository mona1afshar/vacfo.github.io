# Vacfo ðŸ’‰

While attending TOHacks my team members and I were tasked on making a project that would possitively impact the communicty. Since we were finally beginning to roll out covid vaccines into the community, we decided to create a website that would make finding a website easy and accessable to all, especially the elderly in our community.
The purpose of this website was to mimic a real life conversation by using the ADA chatbot function. This project even ended up winning the sponsor prize at the hackathon! Check it out:
